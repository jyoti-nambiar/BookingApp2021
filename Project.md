# motivera varför man har valt just det här ramverket. 

1. As react being an open-source Javascript library , which has a well documention  it was easier to get startoff with React.
2. Because of its poularity , it has a wide community support for development, hence the process of coding became faster and easier.
3. With the community support it was easier to find faults and find possible solutions to the problem from _stackoverflow community_ or any good developers blog.
4. It was easier to develop faster user-interfaces with React.
5. The component based approach of development made it easier to reuse the components and hence save time.

# För och nackdelar med ramverket 
## Advantage of ReactJS
1. Easy to Learn and Use: ReactJS is much easier to learn and use. It comes with a good supply of documentation, tutorials, and training resources. Any developer who comes from a JavaScript background can easily understand and start creating web apps using React in a few days.

2. Creating Dynamic Web Applications Becomes Easier: To create a dynamic web application specifically with HTML strings was tricky because it requires a complex coding, but React JS solved that issue and makes it easier. It provides less coding and gives more functionality. It makes use of the JSX(JavaScript Extension), which is a particular syntax letting HTML quotes and HTML tag syntax to render particular subcomponents.

3. Reusable Components:A ReactJS web application is made up of multiple components, and each component has its own logic and controls. These components are responsible for outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML code which can be reused wherever you need them. The reusable code helps to make your apps easier to develop and maintain.
ReactJS uses virtual DOM based mechanism to fill data in HTML DOM. The virtual DOM works fast as it only changes individual DOM elements instead of reloading complete DOM every time.

4. The Support of Handy Tools: The React Developer Tools have been designed as Chrome and Firefox dev extension and allow you to inspect the React component hierarchies in the virtual DOM. It also allows you to select particular components and examine and edit their current props and state.

5. Known to be SEO Friendly:ReactJS overcomes this problem that helps developers to be easily navigated on various search engines. It is because React.js applications can run on the server, and the virtual DOM will be rendering and returning to the browser as a regular web page.

## Disadvantage of ReactJS
1. The high pace of development: Since the environment continually changes so fast, some of the developers not feeling comfortable to relearn the new ways of doing things regularly. It may be hard for them to adopt all these changes with all the continuous updates. They need to be always updated with their skills and learn new ways of doing things.

2. Poor Documentation :React technologies updating and accelerating so fast that there is no time to make proper documentation.

3. View Part :ReactJS Covers only the UI Layers of the app and nothing else. So you still need to choose some other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development in the project.


# när det är lämplig att använda sig av det. 
It is more efficient to use Reactjs in case of following needs
1. Component reusability for effective development.
2. In cases where the UI needs to be updated quickly and efficiently
   Some of the projects where it can be used are-
1. Q A Websites
2. E-commerce websites
3. Social Network sites
4. Business Website
5. Dashboards 


# Andra möjliga alternativ. 
The other alternative to React can be 
1. AngularJS
2. Vue JS
3. Inferno JS
4. Ember JS
